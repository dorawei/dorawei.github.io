So I have set up this new site with Jekyll, but posting with git seems a little inconvenient, so here is [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com/){:target="_blank"}.

With this online editor (supports both Markdown and Visual) you could write from anywhere on the web now.

Hit Save and Siteleaf will automatically commit your changes to the repo and also you could manage all pages, posts, and upload files, also invite others, all in a visual webpage.

Adding  metadada is also very easy, as shown below.

Except 14 days' free trail of all features, they also afford a free developer plan, which is good enough to enjoy.

#Enjoy.
